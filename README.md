# Indy's React Single Page Application Template

My SPA Template is a personal reference guide / quickstart kit for quickly building and deploying new React Applications.

## Motivation

As a project-oriented developer that most effectively learns from examples, I created this started seed application to be able to quickly jump into new SPA project ideas without wading through some setup steps. It is also an architecture with which I am familiar and whose components I built and will continue to utilize and update.

This project serves as a quickstart and reference guide for:  
- React
- React Styled Components
- Apollo
- Express
- GraphQL
- Mobile-First Responsive Design
- ESLint (Airbnb Styling)

### To-Do:
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- Firebase
